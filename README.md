# Decoding the Decision to Report Sexual Assault

This project uses data from the [National Crime Victimization Survey API](https://bjs.ojp.gov/national-crime-victimization-survey-ncvs-api) from 2002 to 2021 to determine which factors are most impactful in a survivor's likelihood to report a sexual assault. The information is displayed in an interactive site.
